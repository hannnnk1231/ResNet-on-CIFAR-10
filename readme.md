# ResNet on CIFAR-10

This project aims getting the best accuracy with a modified ResNet on CIFAR-10, under the constraint that the model has no more than 5 million parameters. In my experiments, I played with different ResNet architectures, optimizers, regularizers, data augmentation strategies and learning rates. In the end, it came out with **94.83%** accuracy.

You can reproduce the final result by running the `final.ipynb` file. `best.pt` is the result of the best model.

All the jupyter notebook experiment running results can be found under `/experiments` and the logs are in `results/logs`.
